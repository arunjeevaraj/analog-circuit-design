# Biasing

So far, we have pushed one unresolved issue in front of us. We have studied ways to multiply and scale bias currents using current mirrors (see @sec-current-mirror) and we have also found ways to buffer (and scale) bias voltages (see @sec-voltage-buffer-with-ota, scaling can be readily achieved by using a resistive divider in the feedback path). We can generate bias voltages by running a current through a resistor. However, what has not been discussed so far is **how to generate one stable bias current in the first place**.

If we would have a stable reference voltage, then we can use the arrangement shown in @fig-bias-current-gen to generate a bias current that is given by (note the use of feedback using an error amplifier which could be a simple OTA)

$$
I_\mathrm{bias} = \frac{V_\mathrm{ref}}{R_1}.
$$

Using $A_1$ and $M_1$ the voltage $V_\mathrm{ref}$ is regulated across $R_1$ and available at the drain of $M_1$.

{{< include /figures/_fig_bias_current_gen.qmd >}}

The resistor $R_1$ will show variation with the process tolerance, but we can either (a) use an external resistor for a precise current generation, or (b) use some sort of trimming to correct this resistor value. Depending on the further use of the bias currents a variation of the resistor might no be a bad thing. Assuming we use the resulting bias current to generate somewhere a bias voltage $V_\mathrm{bias}$ by running the current through resistor $R_2$, then this voltage is given by

$$
V_\mathrm{bias} = R_2 I_\mathrm{bias} = \frac{R_2}{R_1} V_\mathrm{ref}.
$$

We can see in the above equation that the absolute values of $R_1$ and $R_2$ do not play a role, only the *ratio* is important. Luckily, components in integrated circuits match very well, so we can multiply and scale one reference voltage $V_\mathrm{ref}$ across our IC.

Since all components on chip will experience manufacturing tolerances of at least $\pm 10\%$ we strive for something more accurate. We can resort to an off-chip property like an externally provided reference current or voltage, or use the power supply as a voltage reference (often, power supply rails are specified to $\pm 5 \ldots 10\%$).

The only option left is to use a material property of the silicon itself for stable reference voltage generation.

## Bandgap Reference

It has been realized that a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has the wonderful property, that the base-emitter voltage $\VBE$ has the following approximate relationship vs. temperature [@Widlar_1971]

$$
\VBE \approx V_\mathrm{g0} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_0} \right) + \VBE[0] \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)
$$ {#eq-vbe-vs-temp}

where $V_\mathrm{g0} = 1.205\,\text{V}$ is the bandgap voltage of silicon at $0\,\text{K}$ and $\VBE[0]$ is the base-emitter voltage of a BJT as reference temperature $T_0$. Further, the difference in $\VBE$ of two BJT operated at different emitter current densities $J_1$ and $J_2$ is given as

$$
\Delta \VBE = \frac{k T}{q} \ln \left( \frac{J_1}{J_2} \right)
$$ {#eq-delta-vbe-vs-temp}

with $k$ the Boltzmann constant, and $q$ the elementary charge.

Adding @eq-vbe-vs-temp and @eq-delta-vbe-vs-temp results in a reference voltage of value

$$
V_\mathrm{ref} =  V_\mathrm{g0} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_0} \right) + \VBE[0] \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) +  \frac{k T}{q} \ln \left( \frac{J_1}{J_2} \right)
$$ {#eq-bandgap-voltage-with-temp}

which can be made temperature-insensitive when the terms, which are a function of $T$, cancel each other, and only

$$
V_\mathrm{ref} =  V_\mathrm{g0}
$$ {#eq-bandgap-voltage}

remains. We thus have created an on-chip reference (called the [*bandgap voltage reference*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandgap_voltage_reference)) which is almost independent of manufacturing tolerances with zero temperature coefficient. Of course, this is only true neglecting second-order effects, but nevertheless, reference accuracies of $\pm 1 \ldots 3\%$ without trimming are perfectly possible.

The original implementation in [@Widlar_1971] uses NPN transistors. The question is, where do we find BJT in a CMOS process? Luckily, when looking at the typical implementations, we find that there is a layer sandwich of P-N-P available. While the PNPs constructed parasitically out of this available layers are available for free without extra processing cost, they are very slow, show unusually small $\beta < 10$, and the collector is tied to $\VSS$ as it is the substrate. Still, for bandgap references, they are very useful.

A simple implementation of a bandgap reference circuit is shown in @fig-bandgap-simple [@Gray_Meyer_5th_ed]. If we scale $R_1$ and $R_2$ correctly then we can achieve @eq-bandgap-voltage. Note that the output voltage is ca. $1.2\,\text{V}$, so operating this circuit on low supply voltages will be problematic.

{{< include /figures/_fig_bandgap_reference_simple.qmd >}}

$M_1$ to $M_4$ are scaled in a way that in both branches the same bias current is flowing. Further, $M_1$ and $M_2$ ensure that there is the same potential at their sources. Since the PNP are scaled by the factor $n$ (thus the current density is different) so that the following voltage develops across $R_1$:

$$
\Delta \VBE = \frac{k T}{q} \ln m
$$

Hence, the bias current in all the branches is given by

$$
I_\mathrm{bias} = \frac{\Delta \VBE}{R_1} = \frac{1}{R_1} \frac{k T}{q} \ln m. 
$$ {#eq-bandgap-bias-current}

Inspecting @eq-bandgap-bias-current we see that $I_\mathrm{bias} = k_1 T$ is a linear function of temperature $T$, a property that is very useful and called **PTAT** (proportional to absolute temperature). With $M_5$ we mirror this bias current into the output branch, and the output voltage $V_\mathrm{ref}$ is then given by

$$
V_\mathrm{ref} = \VBE + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \frac{k T}{q} \ln m.  
$$

By proper selection of $R_1$, $R_2$ and $n$ we can satisfy @eq-bandgap-voltage-with-temp to result in @eq-bandgap-voltage.

::: {.callout-note title="Improved Bandgap Reference"}
For an improved implementation of @fig-bandgap-simple, the current mirrors should be cascoded, and a startup circuit should be included to guarantee proper operation after enabling it. Further, @eq-vbe-vs-temp and @eq-delta-vbe-vs-temp build on the relationship $I_\mathrm{C} = f(\VBE)$, while we control $I_\mathrm{E}$ in this circuit. If $\beta$ is large then $I_\mathrm{C} \approx I_\mathrm{E}$, but this is not the case for the used PNPs.
:::

The circuit of @fig-bandgap-simple has been implemented in Xschem and is shown in @fig-bandgap-schematic. The current sources have been improved by using cascodes. No base current compensation is implemented, as it is assumed that the $\beta$ of the PNP are similar although they are operated at different emitter current densities. Note the addition of a startup branch with $M_\mathrm{startup}$ which is inactive during normal operation but will inject a startup current if no proper bias point has yet been found. There is no circuitry added for enabling/disabling the circuit, which would also be needed for a practical implementation.

The resistors $R_{1-4}$ have been implemented out of unit elements of ca. $5\,\text{k}\Omega$ for optimum matching. Building a bandgap for the first time on silicon likely will show a slightly deviating temperature coefficient, which is why we keep a few dummy resistors around in $R_2$ to compensate the TC in a redesign.

![Simple bandgap reference circuit in Xschem.](./xschem/bandgap_simple.svg){#fig-bandgap-schematic}

The Xschem schematic is available [here](./xschem/bandgap_simple.sch) and the simulated reference voltage vs. temperature is shown in @fig-bandgap-sim-result. For a typical process we achieve a TC of $\pm 0.2\%$.

```{python}
#| label: fig-bandgap-sim-result
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Reference voltage from simulated bandgap circuit."
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

filename = "xschem/bandgap_simple.txt"
data = np.loadtxt(filename)
x = data[:, 0]

plt.plot(x, y, linestyle='-', color='b')
plt.xlabel("Temperature (C)")
plt.ylabel("Vref (V)")
#plt.title("Reference Voltage of Bandgap")
plt.grid(True)
```

Please note how tight the dc operating point is in this design to keep all MOSFET saturated. We only use $100\,\text{mV}$ nominally as headroom. The circuit in @fig-bandgap-schematic works only marginally at $\VDD = 1.5\,\text{V}$, but would not work at $1.2\,\text{V}$ or lower. Improved circuit architectures for $<1\,\text{V}$ operation exist [@Banba_1999,@Eberlein_2018].
